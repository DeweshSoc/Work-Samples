                        When perceptions change, challenges become
                        opportunity</u

                    </h4>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Perceptions weave reality. It is not the supposed reality
                      that makes us who we are but actually what we think
                      ourselves to be. If the mind sees fear, we are frightened.
                      If it sees sorrow, we are sad. If we can train our mind to
                      change the perception of fear, we are no longer afraid. If
                      we train it to change perception of sorrow to happiness,
                      we’ll be happy. <br />
                      <br />
                      Challenges are always misunderstood. The purpose of a
                      challenge is not to knock us down, but to give us an
                      opportunity to rise above our mediocre selves. So in a
                      way, challenges are always opportunities. It is the
                      cluttered mind that fails to benefit from this opportunity
                      because the mind is always trapped in the wrong
                      perception. <br />
                      <br />
                      There are countless examples of people benefiting form
                      change of perception: <br />
                      The 32 nd US president, Franklin D Roosevelt was a man of
                      honour who won four successive elections, despite
                      suffering from polio since 1921. He was paralysed from the
                      waist down, but he made sure that his people never know
                      that, because he knew optimism was a necessity for
                      American people in post-war America. He even trained his
                      mind to walk with iron braces, which was extremely
                      painful. He did not succumb to the fear of losing the
                      challenge. He changed his perception and compelled his
                      mind to do what was needed and hence America got its best
                      president after Lincoln. <br />
                      <br />
                      In Mahabharata, Karna was raised in a lower class family.
                      His entire life he was taunted for being the son of a low
                      born. The pathetic cast system made his life miserable but
                      he did not give up to the then atrocious society. He
                      wanted to become the best archer, so he changed his
                      perception of a victim to that of an achiever and then
                      became an archer equal in prowess to Arjuna. <br />
                      <br />
                      There are several other examples. The zest is that a lion
                      is a lion because its perception towards a deer is that of
                      a hunter. A deer will never be equal to a lion because its
                      perception is that of a fearful prey. <br />
                      Reality is just a manifestation of our thoughts,
                      challenges will always be there to keep a check that the
                      worthy always rise above the mediocre and opportunity is
                      equal for everyone. It is only the perception that changes
                      person to person and only the ones who have the ability to
                      have the right perception at the right time for the right
                      cause will be victorious in the end.

                    </h4>
                    

                    <p class="card-text">
                      We live in an era of organised irresponsibility. We
                      cumulatively contribute to risks without being held
                      individually culpable. India, reported its first COVID-19
                      case on January 30, 2020 and first casualty on March 12
                      with a total of 81 cases across the nation by second week
                      of March. What is interesting is that the numbers and
                      statistics no longer bother the Indian public, if it ever
                      did. Though panic in such perilous times would be
                      calamitous but such casual and facetious attitude and
                      response to a pandemic is not acceptable. It seems like
                      life after the Coronavirus outbreak hasn’t changed much.
                      There have been changes in ‘daily-routine’ of people but
                      no significant change in peoples’ lives. With schools and
                      colleges shutdown, it’s just like every day is a Sunday.
                      The very idea of seriousness of a global pandemic hasn’t
                      yet gripped into the minds of the young population of
                      India.<br> <br> On the government’s side, measures are being taken
                      according to the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to enhance
                      preparedness and containment of the virus. Community
                      awareness is being strengthened by utilizing print,
                      electronic and social media in local languages. Local
                      cable TV channels, phone messages, audio announcements and
                      FM radio are being leveraged to disseminate evidence-based
                      information on preventive measures and broadcasting
                      helpline numbers. So the government is actively taking
                      measures but the response of the Indian crowd is sluggish.
                      Some may argue that there is a considerable increase in
                      the usage of precautionary products like masks, sanitizers
                      etc. The fact is that there is a spike in usage of such
                      commodities but only in effected cities, towns, areas and
                      urban centres of the nation which would not even comprise
                      one-third of the total population. There is not a single
                      district which is 100% aware of the situation and is
                      taking required precautions. It is true that in a country
                      with a population as vast as India, everything takes its
                      own nice amount of time but time is not our friend. Though
                      the virus is controllable if it reaches at a community
                      spread level, it would become impossible to keep track and
                      we will literally be at the mercy of the virus with
                      countless deaths. Awareness is important but what is even
                      more important is that there is dire need that people make
                      decisions using their intellect and not their emotions.
                      There was an incident last week when an infected Bangalore
                      family skipped the medical desk at the airport and
                      returned to their home which resulted in infection of four
                      more people. Seven lives put in danger just because going
                      home was important. It is this kind of irresponsibility
                      that can cause mass hysteria. There were few more such
                      cases with ten infected suspects who refused care because
                      of their state of denial to the fact that they were facing
                      a dangerous disease which is another major problem in
                      general. People don’t want to accept the harsh nature of
                      reality and they think that not responding to the change
                      would eliminate its effects which is futile and makes all
                      efforts made by the government go in vain. <br> <br> There is no
                      reason for fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight
                      is over but the need of the hour is awareness, precautions
                      and preventions which would only come if we assimilate the
                      fact that India is hit by a life-threating pandemic which
                      is dangerous but controllable. We need to act and act
                      quick. Till now there is no significant change in our
                      lives after Coronavirus outbreak but we should be ready
                      for unpleasant changes. We should keep in mind that maybe
                      nothing would be same ever again but that does not mean
                      that nothing would be good. We have to be aware and ready
                      because it is our responsibility that this pandemic is put
                      to an end as soon as possible.
